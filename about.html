					<h2>About John Patterson Consulting:</h2>
					<p>
						Hi. My name is John Patterson. All my life I have enjoyed working with machines and helping people.  Through study and hands-on experience, I have collected substantial knowledge on the function of numerous technologies and mechanical systems.  In addition, I have been very successful in my academic career.  With these accomplishments in mind, I have founded John Patterson Consulting, which aims to pass this knowledge onto you to help you achieve your academic objectives and project goals.  To request a consultation, visit the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>, and send an e-mail! Thanks!
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						In addition to consulting work, I also enjoy photography as a hobby. By combining elements of technology and everyday life with elements of composition and style, I enjoy producing a wide variety of digital photographs. See my <a href="photography.html">photography page</a> for examples of some of my work.
